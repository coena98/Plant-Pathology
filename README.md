# Plant-Pathology
This is a project based on detection of plant diseases as a a part of a Kaggle Competition. This competition challenged us to distinguish between leaves which are healthy, those which are infected with apple rust, those that have apple scab, and those with more than one disease. The downloaded data was divided into train and test csv files which had the image ids.
